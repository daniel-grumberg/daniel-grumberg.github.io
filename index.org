#+TITLE: Daniel's Homepage

I am PhD candidate at Imperial College London in the [[https://srg.doc.ic.ac.uk][Software Reliability Group]], working on dynamic analysis techniques to automatically find bugs in applications.
More broadly I am interested in compilers, operating systems, systems programming in general and computer architecture.
You can find my resume [[file:assets/cv.pdf][here]].

I plan to maintain here a bunch of interesting articles about programming topics that I find interesting/relevant to my day-to-day activities.
I don't guarantee that anything here works or is factually correct, but do shoot me an email if you find something wrong.

You can find the source that I use to generate this webpage using Emacs [[https://github.com/daniel-grumberg/daniel-grumberg.github.io][here]].
